# CSS Syntax

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the styling language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. Understanding its syntax is the first step to mastering web design.

## 1. The Anatomy of a CSS Rule

A CSS rule set consists of a **selector** and a **declaration block**.

```css
/* Selector */
h1 {
  /* Declaration Block */
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

### Components Breakdown

1.  **Selector (`h1`)**: This points to the HTML element you want to style. It can be a tag name, a class, an ID, or a complex relationship (which we will cover in the Selectors chapter).
2.  **Declaration Block (`{ ... }`)**: Wraps the style instructions.
3.  **Property (`color`)**: The specific quality you want to change (e.g., color, width, margin).
4.  **Value (`blue`)**: The specific setting for that property.
5.  **Separator (`:`)**: Splits the property from the value.
6.  **Terminator (`;`)**: Ends the instruction. **Crucial**: If you miss this, the browser may ignore the next line.

## 2. Formatting Best Practices

Whitespace is mostly ignored in CSS, but readability is key.

**Good Practice (Multi-line):**
```css
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}
```

**Valid but Bad (Single-line):**
```css
p{color:red;text-align:center;}
```
*Use single-line only for very small, utility-like classes.*

## 3. Comments

Comments are lines of code ignored by the browser. They are for humans.

```css
/* This is a single line comment */
p {
  color: red; /* Inline comment */
}

/* 
   This is a multi-line comment.
   Useful for section headers or
   disabling large blocks of code.
*/
```

## 4. Case Sensitivity

- **CSS Keywords**: Not case-sensitive. `COLOR: RED` is the same as `color: red`.
- **Selectors (HTML Hooks)**: **Case-sensitive**. Class names `.Sidebar` and `.sidebar` are different.

## 5. Interactive Playground

Try modifying the syntax below. Remove the semicolon after `blue` and see what happens to the font size (it might break!).

<Playground 
  initialHTML={`<h1>Hello World</h1>\n<p>Syntax is easy.</p>`}
  initialCSS={`h1 {\n  color: blue;\n  font-size: 40px;\n}\n\np {\n  font-family: monospace;\n  background-color: #eee;\n  padding: 10px;\n}`}
/>

## 6. Important Interview Questions

<details>
  <summary>**1. What does CSS stand for?**</summary>
  **Cascading Style Sheets**.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**2. What happens if you forget a semicolon?**</summary>
  The browser often cannot parse where the next property begins, causing it to discard the *next* property (and potentially the rest of the block).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**3. Is CSS a programming language?**</summary>
  Technically, it is a **Style Sheet Language**. However, with modern features like Variables (`--var`), Calculations (`calc()`), and Nesting, it is gaining programming-like capabilities (Turing completeness is debated, but generally "no" in the imperative sense).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**4. How does the browser handle unknown properties?**</summary>
  It **ignores** them. This is a feature, not a bug, allowing new CSS features to be added without breaking old browsers (Progressive Enhancement).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**5. Can you nest comments?**</summary>
  **No**. Identifying the end of a comment is done by finding the first `*/`.
