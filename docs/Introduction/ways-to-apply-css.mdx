# Ways to apply CSS

There are three distinct methods to apply CSS to HTML. Each has a specific use case, though one is the industry standard.

## 1. External CSS (Recommended)

You create a separate `.css` file and link it in the HTML `<head>`.

**HTML:**
```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

**CSS (`styles.css`):**
```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

### Why use it?
- **Global Scope**: One file changes the whole site.
- **Caching**: Loaded once, reused everywhere.
- **Clean Code**: Keeps HTML purely for structure.

## 2. Internal CSS

You write CSS inside a `<style>` tag within the HTML file, usually in the `<head>`.

**HTML:**
```html
<head>
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

### Why use it?
- **Single Page Styles**: When a specific page needs unique overrides not relevant to the rest of the site.
- **Email Templates**: Email clients often require styles to be in the same file.

## 3. Inline CSS

You write CSS directly on the element using the `style` attribute.

**HTML:**
```html
<p style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">I am blue.</p>
```

### Why use it?
- **Dynamic Styling**: JavaScript often applies animations or coordinates via inline styles.
- **Quick Testing**: Debugging a specific element.

### Why to avoid it?
- **Specificity Hell**: Hard to override (needs `!important`).
- **Maintenance**: Changes require finding every instance in HTML.
- **Payload**: bloating HTML size.

## 4. The `@import` Rule

A way to load CSS *from inside* CSS.

```css
@import url("navigation.css");
@import url("footer.css");
```

*Performance Note: Using multiple `@import` rules can create a "waterfall" effect where files load one by one, slowing down the site. `<link>` is preferred.*

## 5. Interactive Playground

See how **Inline** beats **Internal**. The internal block sets color to `red`, but the inline attribute sets it to `purple`. Purple wins!

<Playground 
  initialHTML={`<!-- Inline style overrides Internal -->\n<h1 style="color: purple;">I have higher priority!</h1>\n\n<h1>I follow internal rules.</h1>`}
  initialCSS={`/* Internal Style */\nh1 {\n  color: red;\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}`}
/>

## 6. Important Interview Questions

<details>
  <summary>**1. Which application method has the highest priority?**</summary>
  **Inline CSS** overrides Internal and External CSS (unless `!important` is used).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**2. What is the priority order for Internal vs External?**</summary>
  It depends on **Source Order**. Whichever is defined *last* in the `<head>` wins. If `<link>` corresponds to external, and `<style>` corresponds to internal, placing `<style>` after `<link>` makes internal win.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**3. What is FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) and how to avoid it?**</summary>
  It's when the user sees raw HTML before CSS loads. Avoid it by placing all CSS `<link>` tags in the `<head>`, never in the `<body>`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**4. Can you link a stylesheet inside the `<body>`?**</summary>
  Technically browsers might render it, but it is invalid HTML5 and causes performance issues (repainting). Always put it in `<head>`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**5. Why are multiple `<link>` tags better than `@import`?**</summary>
  Browsers can download multiple `<link>` files in **parallel**. With `@import`, the browser must download the first file, parse it, find the import, and *then* download the second, creating a chain delay.
