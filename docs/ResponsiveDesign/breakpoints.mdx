# Breakpoints

Breakpoints are the pixel widths where your layout "breaks" or changes to adapt to the new size.

## 1. Common Breakpoints (Bootstrap Standard)

- **Extra Small (xs)**: < 576px (Phones portrait)
- **Small (sm)**: ≥ 576px (Phones landscape)
- **Medium (md)**: ≥ 768px (Tablets)
- **Large (lg)**: ≥ 992px (Desktops)
- **Extra Large (xl)**: ≥ 1200px (Wide screens)

## 2. Strategy

Do not target specific devices (e.g., iPhone 12 width). Target **content**. Add a breakpoint when your design looks broken.

## 3. SCSS / Mixins (Bonus)

In professional projects, we abstract breakpoints:
```scss
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) { ... }
```

## 4. Important Interview Questions

<details>
  <summary>**1. How many breakpoints should you have?**</summary>
  Usually 3 or 4 major ones (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, Wide). Too many makes maintenance hard.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**2. Can you nest media queries?**</summary>
  Yes (in SCSS natively, or CSS nesting level 4), but usually they are written at the bottom of the file or in separate files.
