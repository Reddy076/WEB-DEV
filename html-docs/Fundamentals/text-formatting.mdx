# Text Formatting

HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.

## Headings
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage. They range from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important).

:::info Accessibility
Search engines use your headings to index the structure and content of your web pages. Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
:::

## paragraphs
The `<p>` element defines a paragraph. Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each `<p>` element.

## Formatting Elements

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `<b>` | Bold text (without semantic importance) |
| `<strong>` | **Important** text (bold visually) |
| `<i>` | Italic text (without semantic importance) |
| `<em>` | *Emphasized* text (italic visually) |
| `<mark>` | Marked or highlighted text |
| `<small>` | Smaller text |
| `<del>` | Deleted (strikethrough) text |
| `<ins>` | Inserted (underlined) text |
| `<sub>` | Subscript text (e.g., H₂O) |
| `<sup>` | Superscript text (e.g., X²) |
| `<blockquote>` | Defines a section that is quoted from another source |
| `<q>` | Defines a short inline quotation |
| `<pre>` | Defines preformatted text (preserves spaces and line breaks) |
| `<code>` | Defines a piece of computer code |
