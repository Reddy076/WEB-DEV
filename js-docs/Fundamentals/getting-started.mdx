# Getting Started with JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted, dynamically-typed programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on web pages. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has evolved into one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It enables:

- **Interactive web pages** - Forms, animations, dynamic content
- **Single-page applications (SPAs)** - React, Vue, Angular apps
- **Server-side development** - Node.js, Express
- **Mobile applications** - React Native, Ionic
- **Desktop applications** - Electron

## Key Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Interpreted** | Code is executed line by line without prior compilation |
| **Dynamically Typed** | Variable types are determined at runtime, not compile time |
| **Multi-paradigm** | Supports object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming |
| **Single-threaded** | Uses one main thread with an event loop for async operations |
| **Cross-platform** | Runs in browsers and servers (Node.js) |

## Where JavaScript Runs

1. **Browser**: Client-side execution for interactive web pages
2. **Server**: Node.js enables server-side JavaScript
3. **Mobile**: React Native, Ionic for mobile app development
4. **Desktop**: Electron for desktop applications

## Adding JavaScript to HTML

There are three ways to add JavaScript to your HTML document:

### 1. External File (Recommended)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  
  <!-- External JavaScript file -->
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. Internal Script

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  
  <!-- Internal script -->
  <script>
    console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
    document.querySelector('h1').style.color = 'blue';
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 3. Inline JavaScript (Not Recommended)

```html
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
```

:::warning Best Practice
Always prefer external JavaScript files for better maintainability, caching, and separation of concerns.

import JSPlayground from '@site/src/components/JSPlayground';

## Interactive Playground

Try running your first JavaScript code:

<JSPlayground 
  initialCode={`// Your first JavaScript program!
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
console.log("Welcome to the JavaScript course");

// Try some math
let result = 10 + 20;
console.log("10 + 20 =", result);

// Current date
console.log("Today is:", new Date().toDateString());`}
/>

## Important Interview Questions

<details>
  <summary>**1. What is JavaScript?**</summary>
  JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that enables interactive web pages. It runs in browsers and servers (via Node.js) and supports object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming paradigms.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**2. What's the difference between Java and JavaScript?**</summary>
  Despite similar names, they are completely different languages:
  - **Java**: Compiled, strongly typed, class-based OOP, runs in JVM
  - **JavaScript**: Interpreted, dynamically typed, prototype-based, runs in browsers/Node.js
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**3. Is JavaScript synchronous or asynchronous?**</summary>
  JavaScript is **single-threaded and synchronous** by default, but it supports **asynchronous** operations through callbacks, promises, and async/await using the event loop.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**4. What does 'use strict' do?**</summary>
  `'use strict'` enables strict mode which catches common coding errors, prevents use of undeclared variables, and makes it easier to write secure JavaScript.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**5. Where should the script tag be placed?**</summary>
  Ideally at the **end of the body tag** (before `</body>`) to ensure the DOM is loaded before the script runs. Alternatively, use `defer` or `async` attributes in the `<head>`.
</details>
